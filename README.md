# Resume-WordPress
This is a very simple website with my resume. I have kept it very simple and minimalist to maintain the professionalism in the design of the website. There is consistency in the colors and theme to maintain a good overall UX/UI for the viewers

## Use of Plugins 

I have used minimum plugins as too many plugins become an overkill.
### Elementor
The elementor plugin is the most used for formatting in the entire website. It makes editing the pages very easy. Other plugins that can be used to edit the page can be Coblocks Gutenberg or the classic editor. 
### SEO 
Since SEO is the most consistent way of bringing traffic to the website, Rank math SEO plugin is used to give owners get access to the tools on how to improve it. Other plugins which include the Yoast SEO plugin can also be used but it doesn't provide the same functionality as the Rank math plugin. 
### contact
There is also a use of form for feedback or contact purpose. The plugin used was wpform lite which is beginer friendly and very easy to use. Other plugin that can be used is the ninja contact forms which is equally good.
